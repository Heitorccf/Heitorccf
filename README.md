# Hey! Nice to meet you 👋 

🎓 **IT Student** - Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of São Paulo (IFSP)  
👨🏻‍💻 **Programming and Data Science Enthusiast**

I love diving into code and working with data! When I'm not building type-safe applications with TypeScript or developing with Laravel, you can find me analyzing datasets and working on machine learning projects. I enjoy both worlds - crafting efficient backend solutions and uncovering insights from data.

## 🚀 What I'm Up To
These days I'm working on backend development with TypeScript and PHP frameworks while also exploring data analysis. I love solving complex problems, whether it's architecting a scalable API or finding interesting patterns in datasets. Currently diving deeper into NestJS and machine learning - there's always something new to learn in tech!

## 📚 What Keeps Me Busy
- Creating robust backend systems with TypeScript and PHP
- Exploring data science and machine learning
- Building efficient APIs and microservices
- Working with data pipelines and analysis
- Experimenting with AI models
